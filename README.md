# zig-libxml2

This project is a wrapper around
[libxml2](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2) and
[libxslt](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxslt) to build them using the Zig
build system.

Thanks to the existing projects
[mitchellh/zig-libxml2](https://github.com/mitchellh/zig-libxml2) and
[mitchellh/zig-build-libxml2](https://github.com/mitchellh/zig-build-libxml2/)
for providing inspiration for this project. This project is not directly built
on either of them, as I wanted to take another direction with this wrapper (and
also bring in libxslt).
